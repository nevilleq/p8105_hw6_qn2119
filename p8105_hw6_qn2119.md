Problem 1
=========

``` r
#Read in the wp homicide data
wp.homicide.df <- read_csv("./data/wp_homicide_data.csv")

#Snag Dimensions and summary
dim.wp.df <- dim(wp.homicide.df)

#Unique City/State locations
unique.locations <- wp.homicide.df %>% distinct(., city, state) %>% nrow() #Problem, Tulsa, AL not a city
                                                                           #Error, only one observation, lat/long matches OK

#New city_state variable and data nest
city.homicide.df <- wp.homicide.df %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "), #Create new city_state var with string concatenate
    unsolved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest", TRUE, FALSE)
  ) %>% select(city_state, everything()) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" &
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  mutate(
    victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white") %>%
      as.factor() %>% fct_relevel(., "white", "non-white")
  )
```
